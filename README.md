# 🍿🎬 NgFlix - Angular Movies & Series Web Application

NgFlix is a web application that allows users to search, filter, save and view details for movies and TV shows built with Angular 20, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. 
The design was inspired by a Figma project: https://www.figma.com/design/sN4wndevyr97MI9ht5LP4b/Movie---Series-Streaming-Platform--Community-?node-id=10004-16470&t=IbIN9mW7bHJAGu22-1

This project helped me to deepen my knowledge of Angular (18+) and libraries like RxJx. DotEnv library was used to hide and save the TDMD API Key to the environment variables since Angular doesn't provide a native .env file like React and Next.js. Moreover, it's my first project built with PNPM instead of NPM!
